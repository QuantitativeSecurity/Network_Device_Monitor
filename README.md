Network and Device Monitoring System

This script monitors and logs network and device activities, particularly focusing on network connections, data transfer between devices, and potential security breaches such as outbound information with duplicate text. It employs classes to represent different components of a computer network, like Motherboard, Router, Monitor, and various devices connected to the network.
Features:

    Monitoring: Monitors network connections and logs any unexpected activities or potential security breaches.
    Device Interaction: Represents interaction between different network devices and logs data transfer between them.
    Logging: Utilizes Pythonâ€™s logging module to keep a record of network and device activities, warnings, and potential security breaches.
    IP Management: Monitors router IP and logs any changes to it.
    Security: Blocks communication with certain IP addresses and logs duplicate outbound information.

Usage:

    Ensure the psutil library is installed. You can install it via pip:

    pip install psutil

    Run the script. The script will start monitoring the network and device activities and log them into the specified log file.
    Review the log file (log.txt by default) regularly to monitor network activities and to check for any warnings or potential security breaches.

Code Structure:

    Monitor: Represents a Monitor device with methods to display images and log activities.
    Motherboard: Represents a motherboard that manages connected devices and network connections and logs activities and warnings.
    Device: Base class for different devices like Router, Ethernet, and WiFi, with methods to send and receive data.
    Router, Ethernet, WiFi: Represent different types of devices connected to the network.
    get_router_ip: Function to get the router IP.
    main: The main function where different devices are created and connected to the motherboard.

Important Notes:

    Modify the placeholder values in the script like router IP ("XXXX"), MAC address ("XXXXXXXX"), and others according to your actual setup before running the script.
    Regularly review the log file and other output files generated by the script to monitor network activities and identify potential security issues.
    The main function is the entry point of the script where different devices are initialized and connected, but it is not being called in the provided script. Make sure to call the main function at the end of the script, like this:

    python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

    Adjust the logging level and format as per your preference.
